This was a research project I completed where I authored a 30-page research paper with a PhD student from Carnegie Mellon. I diagnosed professional cricket performance in the Pakistan Super League through a  Logistic Regression model using Principal Component Analysis, ending up with an RÂ² value of 0.8 and an accuracy of 85%. My research was utilized by the Karachi Kings cricket team in the Pakistan Super League to enhance their auction strategy!
